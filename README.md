# Installing

1. Add to your resources folder.

2. Add `start Coloured-Poodles` to your server.cfg

# Regarding YMT files in FiveM

Coloured Poodles has a modified .ymt file which allows for the Poodle to have more than one texture, because of this, it is important to know that if you have any custom add-on clothing in your server, you may run into game crashes.

Depending on the GTA 5 game build/version you are running, the amount of add-on clothing packs you are able to stream, seems to be as following:

| Game build number | Alias           | Description                           | YMT files |
|------------------:|:----------------|:--------------------------------------|----------:|
|              1604 | mpchristmas2018 | Arena Wars (default FiveM game build) |        14 |
|              2189 | mpheist4        | Cayo Perico Heist                     |         6 |
|              2372 | mptuners        | Tuners DLC                            |         4 |

Please take this into consideration before downloading and adding this to your server.



Enjoy =)
